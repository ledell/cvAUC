# News for the cvAUC package. #


To Do
-----------------
* Consider automatically converting `labels` or `predictions` to a vector if it's a 1-column data.frame.  Otherwise, it will fail the check that `length(unique(labels)) == 2` and `length(predictions) == length(labels)`.


cvAUC 1.1.0 (12-07-2014)
-----------------
* Major rewrite of `ci.cvAUC` and `ci.pooled.cvAUC` to improve runtime performance by many orders of magnitude.
* The package now depends on the `data.table` package.
* Thanks to David Rosenberg for the suggestion to use `data.table` sorting.
* Note that `R CMD CHECK` will produce a note mentioning "No visible binding for global variable..." for several lines in the `data.table`-related code.  This is nothing to worry about.

* Added a `README.md` file for GitHub.  This package is now on GitHub at: https://github.com/ledell/cvAUC


cvAUC 1.0.2 (11-17-2014)
-----------------
* Modified the `AUC` function to be able to use the `label.ordering` argument, similar to `cvAUC`.
* Made a few small edits to `ci.cvAUC` and `ci.pooled.cvAUC` functions as well as `.process_input`.
* Changed license to Apache 2.0.


cvAUC 1.0.1 (11-04-2014)
-----------------
* Added `AUC` utility function for simple AUC calculation (no cross-validation).
* Added example of `ci.pooled.cvAUC` function to documentation.
* Removed the `covProb.sim` simulation function.  This simulation should no longer be used.
* Prepended the `ROCR` package name to the `ROCR::performance` and `ROCR::prediction` functions inside the `AUC` and `cvAUC` functions.
* Removed `require(ROCR)` from functions since ROCR is a required dependency.
* Switched versioning convention from -0 to .0 in third digit.


cvAUC 1.0-0 (12-06-2012)
-----------------
* Initial CRAN release.
